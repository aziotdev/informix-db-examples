Informix timeseries is a special column type that represents a subtable of timeseries data elements.

Accessing Informix timeseries data takes either creating a virtual table interface on your database server to give a flattend presentation of the table and timeseries sub-table, or using the timeseries APIs and SQL functions to operate on the timeseries data.
